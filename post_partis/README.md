Python modules for processing partis output

TODO:
Occasionally the cluster given in the annotations file will not be the one we want.
Create a flag and handle this case (say: `--select_clustering *int*`) using partition file as input.

It might also be nice to output
- whether a cluster contains an input seed and 
- the number of sequences in that particular cluster.
