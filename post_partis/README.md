# Python modules for processing partis output

Run `bash scripts/demo.sh` for an example.

Currently the only examples are to output separate `.fa` files for seed `QB850.424-Vk` and a single `.fa` file with all clusters for seed `QA255.006-Vh`.

Once `partis` finishes running on the multiple seeds case (seeds `QB850.424-Vk` and `QB850.043-Vk`) the middle, commented out lines can be run.
